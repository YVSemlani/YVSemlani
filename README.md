# Hi, I'm Yash Semlani!

I'm a sophomore at UNC Chapel Hill studying Computer Science and Applied Math. 

I spend my time learning about efficient inference, ML for games, and geometric ML by reading papers and working on research or projects. In my free time, I study and play poker as a member of the UNC Poker Club and dabble in the guitar.
